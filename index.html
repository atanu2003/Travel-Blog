        <p class="para1">I am a curious boy who loves to wander around to create memories and learn new things. I love meeting people and indulge in heartfelt conversations. The countryside lures me more than cities. I find joy in all the small things in life. Sometimes an exchange of smile with a stranger can uplift my mood. Emotions run high in my life. 
            Upon arriving in Kyoto, I'm immediately struck by the city's timeless charm. Our first stop is the iconic Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion, gleaming under the afternoon sun. The shimmering reflection on the pond creates a surreal atmosphere, transporting us to a bygone era of shoguns and samurais.
